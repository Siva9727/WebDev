There are two types of units we use to represent the elements like pixel.
They are 1--> Absolute units eg. px, cm, mm , pt etc. 
    Usually pixel is the most used absoute unit.
2--> Relative units;
    One of the most used units. Eg. em, rem, vh etc.
    
    em--->  inherits the units from its parent element.
    rem---> root em.
        --> inherits the units from the root html document. By default font-size is  16px.
    % --->  this is relative to the parent element's size.
    vh and vw --> viewport height and viewport width or view height and view width
            ----> viewport means user's visible area of a web page.
            1vh = 1% of the viewport height.
            100vh = 100% of the viewport height.
**The em and rem units are practical in creating perfectly scalable layout!**
